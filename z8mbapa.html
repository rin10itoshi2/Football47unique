        <B>Kylian Mbappé Lottin</B><br> (born 20 December 1998) is a French professional footballer who plays as a forward for La Liga club Real Madrid and captains the France national team. Regarded as one of the best players in the world, he is known for his dribbling, finishing, and speed.[2][3][4]

        Born in Paris and raised in nearby Bondy, Mbappé began his senior club career in 2015 with Monaco, where he won the Ligue 1 title in the 2016–17 season. In 2017, aged 18, Mbappé signed for Paris Saint-Germain on an eventual permanent transfer worth €180 million, making him the second-most-expensive player and most expensive teenage player of all time.[5] With PSG, he won six Ligue 1 titles and four Coupes de France, including a domestic quadruple in the 2019–20 season, while also leading the club to its first ever UEFA Champions League final in 2020. He is the club's all-time top goalscorer, ranks third in assists, and is the seventh-highest goalscorer in Ligue 1 history. In 2024, after several years of speculation, Mbappé joined Real Madrid on a free transfer. He won the UEFA Super Cup and the FIFA Intercontinental Cup in the first half of his debut season, scoring in both finals.

        At international level, Mbappé made his senior debut for France in 2017, at age of 18. At the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Mbappé became the youngest French player to score at a World Cup, as well as the second teenager, after Pelé, to score in a World Cup final. He finished as the joint second-highest goalscorer as France won the tournament; he went on to win the FIFA World Cup Best Young Player and French Player of the Year awards for his performances. He also helped France to victory in the UEFA Nations League in 2021, receiving the top scorer award in the finals. At the 2022 FIFA World Cup, France reached the final again; Mbappé won the Golden Boot and Silver Ball and set the record for the most goals scored in World Cup final matches by scoring a hat-trick. Mbappé is one of only two players to have scored in two consecutive World Cup finals (the other being Brazil's Vavá in 1958 and 1962).

        Mbappé finished in third place for the 2023 Ballon d'Or and was runner-up for the 2022 The Best FIFA Men's Player award. He was named to the FIFA FIFPro World11 in 2018, 2019, 2022 and 2023, the UEFA Team of the Year in 2018 and the UEFA Champions League Squad of the Season in 2016–17, 2019–20, 2020–21 and 2021–22. He was awarded the Golden Boy in 2017, the Kopa Trophy in 2018, and was shortlisted for the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year in 2019 and 2023. Mbappé has been named Ligue 1 Player of the Year a record five times, and has finished as the Ligue 1 top scorer for a record six seasons; in the 2021–22 season, he became the first player to finish as both Ligue 1 top scorer and top assist provider. In 2023, he was named as one of the Time's 100 most influential people in the world, and was ranked third on the Forbes list of the world's highest-paid athletes.
        
        <br><b>Early life</b><br>
        Kylian Mbappé Lottin[6] was born on 20 December 1998[7] in the 19th arrondissement of Paris[8] and was raised in Bondy, Seine-Saint-Denis, in the northeastern suburbs of Paris.[9] His father, Wilfrid Mbappé [fr], is a football coach and is originally from the Cameroonian island of Djébalè [fr],[10] which is home to the Sawa people. His mother and agent, Fayza Lamari [fr], is of Algerian Kabyle origin and is a former handball player.[11][12][13][14] He has a younger brother, Ethan, who plays for Lille.[15][16] Their older adoptive brother, Jirès Kembo Ekoko, is a former professional footballer.[17]

        As a child, Mbappé went to a private Catholic school in Bondy, where he was considered academically gifted but unruly.[18] At 15, he began taking Spanish lessons, and eventually became fluent in the language.[19] Among Mbappé's idols growing up were Zinedine Zidane,[20] Cristiano Ronaldo,[21] Neymar,[22] Ronaldinho,[23] Lionel Messi,[22] Ronaldo Nazario,[24] Eden Hazard[25] and Thierry Henry.[26][27] As a child, Mbappé received Robinho's AC Milan shirt as a gift from his nanny's family, who were Italians and supporters of the club.[28][29] However, his own favourite team had always been Real Madrid.[30] In May 2024, just days before his transfer to Real Madrid was announced, Mbappé said that he still follows Serie A and AC Milan, and would like to play for the Rossoneri if he is ever to move to Italy in the future.[31]

        <br><b>Club career</b><br>
        <br><b>Early career</b><br>
        Mbappé was coached by his father, Wilfried, when he started his career with AS Bondy. Another of his youth coaches at AS Bondy, Antonio Riccardi, stated,

        The first time I coached him was when he was six years old. You could tell he was different. Kylian could do much more than the other children. His dribbling was already fantastic and he was much faster than the others. He was the best player I've ever seen in 15 years coaching here. In Paris, there are many talents but I'd never seen a talent like him. He was what we call a 'crack' (the best).[32]

        Eventually, Mbappé moved to the Clairefontaine academy, putting in a host of impressive performances leading to numerous French clubs, and Real Madrid, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City and Bayern Munich, attempting to sign him.[14] At the age of 11, Real Madrid invited him to train with their under-12s and visit the club's facilities.[33] Mbappé was tracked by Caen for three years, but their relegation from Ligue 1 in 2012 and subsequent failure to win promotion meant that they could not afford his signature.[34][35] At age 14, he travelled to London after an invite from Chelsea, playing a match for their youth team against Charlton Athletic.[36]

        Monaco<br><b></b><br>
        In July 2013, at the age of 14, Mbappé joined the youth academy of Monaco, signing a three-year contract.[37][38] The club had beat competition from Real Madrid and Zinedine Zidane, who was "very involved" in efforts to sign him.[39]

        2015–2017: Breakthrough and league title<br><b></b><br>
        In October 2015, Mbappé was brought in by Leonardo Jardim to be a mainstay in Monaco's reserve team, but his level of skill and maturity prompted his promotion to the main squad after just three weeks.[40] He made his first-team debut two months later, on 2 December 2015, in a 1–1 Ligue 1 home draw against Caen, replacing Fábio Coentrão after 88 minutes. Mbappé therefore became Monaco's youngest-ever first-team player, aged 16 years and 347 days, breaking the previous record set by Thierry Henry in 1994.[37][41]

        On 20 February 2016, Mbappé scored his first goal for the club's first team, a stoppage-time goal in a 3–1 league win over Troyes at the Stade Louis II; at the age of 17 years and 62 days, he became the youngest first-team goalscorer in Monaco's history – once again displacing Henry in the process.[42][43] On 6 March 2016, Mbappé signed his first professional contract, a three-year deal, tying him to Monaco until June 2019.[44] In an interview with CNN, Vadim Vasilyev, Monaco's vice-president, stated that he knew early on that Mbappé was a "phenomenon".[45]


        Mbappé warming up for Monaco in 2017<br><b></b><br>
        Mbappé scored the first hat-trick of his first-team career on 14 December 2016, in a 7–0 home win over Rennes in the Coupe de la Ligue round of 16 – the first hat-trick scored by any Monaco player in the competition since Sonny Anderson in 1997.[46][47][41] On 11 February 2017, Mbappé scored the first Ligue 1 hat-trick of his career in a 5–0 home win over Metz; at 18 years and two months, he became the youngest player to score a league hat-trick since Jérémy Ménez did so for Sochaux back in 2005.[48] On 21 February, Mbappé scored Monaco's second goal in the 40th minute of a 5–3 loss away to Manchester City in the UEFA Champions League round of 16. It was his first European-competition goal, and he became the second-youngest French scorer in Champions League history, behind only Karim Benzema.[49][50] On 5 March, Mbappé scored two first-half goals in a 4–0 home win over Nantes to bring his Ligue 1 career tally to ten goals, becoming the youngest player in the previous thirty years to reach the ten-goal mark in the league.[51][52] On 11 March, he scored a goal in a 2–1 home win over Bordeaux, registering his seventh goal in his previous four league starts.[53]

        On 15 March 2017, Mbappé scored Monaco's opening goal in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16 tie with Manchester City. Monaco went on to win 3–1, and with the aggregate score being tied 6–6, advanced to the quarter-finals thanks to the away goals rule.[54] In the quarter-finals against Borussia Dortmund, Mbappé won a penalty and scored two goals as Monaco won the first leg 3–2 at the Westfalenstadion.[55] In the second leg at home, he opened the scoring as Monaco won 3–1 and advanced to the semi-finals.[56] They were eventually eliminated from the Champions League following a 4–1 loss on aggregate to Juventus, with Mbappé scoring his team's lone goal in the second leg.[57] Mbappé ended the 2016–17 season with 26 goals from 44 matches in all competitions, as Monaco won the Ligue 1 title.[58] He credited fellow Monaco striker Radamel Falcao as a key influence on him throughout the season, giving him the space to express himself and teaching him to be "calm" and "serene" during the game.[59]

        Paris Saint-Germain<br><b></b><br>
        2017–2020: Record transfer and immediate success
        On 31 August 2017, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) announced the signing of Mbappé from Monaco on loan with a mandatory purchase option of €180 million.[60][61] According to PSG's assistant sporting director Luis Ferrer, the shift in Mbappé's decision to join the club was partly thanks to a "convincing" speech given by manager Unai Emery at the Mbappés' home over the summer.[62][63][64] The €180 million fee made Mbappé the most expensive teenager ever and the second-most-expensive player ever (behind teammate Neymar), and broke the record for the largest transfer within a domestic league.[65][66][67][68] He was handed the number 29 shirt upon arrival in the French capital.[69]

        On 8 September 2017, Mbappé made his PSG debut in a 5–1 Ligue 1 win away at Metz, scoring a goal.[70] Four days later, he recorded his first European goal for the club in a 5–0 UEFA Champions League group stage away defeat of Celtic.[71] He starred in PSG's 3–0 victory over Bayern Munich in the second group game of the Champions League, setting up goals for Edinson Cavani and Neymar, the latter seeing him taking out a defender with a feint by rolling the ball under his foot.[72] On 6 December, Mbappé scored his tenth career Champions League goal in a 3–1 defeat to Bayern Munich, becoming the youngest player to reach that mark, at the age of 18 years and 11 months.[73] Having already won his first league title with the club, on 8 May 2018, Mbappé featured in PSG's 2–0 win over Les Herbiers in the Coupe de France final.[74]

        In July 2018, Mbappé was given the number 7 jersey for the upcoming season with PSG, taking up the squad number left vacant by Lucas Moura.[75] Sporting the hashtag #K7LIAN, Mbappé stated, "I keep trying to progress on the pitch and I think that, for me, it was the right time to change number. It is something of an affirmation. The No. 7 shirt is a legendary one and many greats have worn it. I hope that I will be able to do this number justice on the pitch."[75]

        In his first appearance of the season, Mbappé scored twice in the last 10 minutes as PSG won 3–1 against Guingamp in Ligue 1.[76] In the following league game, the front three of Mbappé, Cavani and Neymar all scored in a 3–1 win over Angers at home, with Mbappé – starting his first game of the season – scoring from a volley and setting up Neymar to score the third.[77] On 1 September, he scored and assisted in a 4–2 away win over Nîmes, but was sent off for the first time in his career with a straight red card in injury time, after shoving Téji Savanier in retaliation for a late challenge from behind, for which Savanier was also sent off.[78] Regarding his sending-off, Mbappé told reporters after the match, "If I had the chance to do it over again, I would do the same thing. I will apologise to the supporters and everybody, but I cannot tolerate this sort of thing."[79] On 8 October, Mbappé scored four goals in just 13 minutes in a 5–0 home victory over Lyon and became the youngest player (at 19 years and 9 months) to score four goals in one game in Ligue 1 over the last forty-five seasons.[80] On 3 December, Mbappé was the inaugural winner of the Kopa Trophy, which is awarded by France Football to the best under-21 player in the world.[81]

        On 19 January 2019, Mbappé was one of two players (the other being Cavani) to score a hat-trick in a 9–0 win over Guingamp, breaking a record PSG had set the previous season.[82] On 12 February, he scored a goal in a 2–0 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford in the Champions League round of 16.[83] On 2 March, he scored twice in a 2–1 away win over Caen to reach his 50th goal with the club.[84] On 6 March, PSG lost 3–1 at home against Manchester United and was subsequently knocked out from the Champions League on the away goals rule.[85] On 21 April, he scored a hat-trick in a 3–1 win against Monaco, netting his first goals against his former club.[86] PSG finished the season as Ligue 1 champions,[87] with Mbappé winning the Player of the Year award,[88] while also finishing the season as the top goalscorer with 33 goals.[87]

        On 3 August 2019, Mbappé scored in a 2–1 win over Rennes to capture his first title of the 2019–20 season, the Trophée des Champions.[89] He then scored again in PSG's opening Ligue 1 match of the season, a 3–0 home win over Nîmes on 11 August.[90] On 22 October, he came off the bench and scored a perfect hat-trick in a 5–0 away win over Belgian side Club Brugge in the Champions League;[91] at the age of 20 years and 306 days, he became the youngest player ever to score at least 15 goals in the competition.[92]

        On 1 May 2020, PSG were crowned Ligue 1 champions after the season had been called off amid the COVID-19 pandemic; at the time of the league's premature suspension, PSG were in first place, with a twelve–point lead over second–placed Marseille.[93][94] Mbappé finished the 2019–20 season as joint-top scorer in Ligue 1 with 18 goals, along with Monaco's Wissam Ben Yedder; however, Mbappé was assigned the title due to his higher goals-per-game ratio.[95] On 24 July, in the Coupe de France final against Saint-Étienne, Mbappé was forced off after sustaining an injury following a challenge from Loïc Perrin, who was sent off; PSG won the match 1–0,[96] although Mbappé was ruled out of the Coupe de la Ligue final,[97] which PSG went on to win, completing a domestic treble.[98] He returned to action in the Champions League quarter-final against Atalanta on 12 August, coming on a substitute, and assisting Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting's match–winning goal in injury time.[99] PSG eventually suffered a 1–0 loss to Bayern Munich in the Champions League final on 23 August.[100]

        2020–2022: Further triumphs and contract extension
        Mbappé missed the first three matches of the season after contracting COVID-19 while being on international duty.[101] He returned to action on 20 September 2020, in a 3–0 away win against Nice, and scored a goal from a penalty kick.[102] On 28 October, Mbappé recorded two assists, both for Moise Kean, in a 2–0 Champions League group stage victory against İstanbul Başakşehir.[103] In doing so, he became the player with the most assists in the competition since the beginning of the 2017–18 edition, with his tally adding up to fourteen over the four seasons.[104] In a Ligue 1 match against Montpellier on 5 December, Mbappé scored his 100th goal for PSG, becoming only the fifth player to achieve the feat for the Parisian club.[105] In his side's final Champions League group match, Mbappé scored his first two goals of the European campaign against Başakşehir, as PSG won 5–1 and qualified for the knockout phase as group winners.[106] He also became the youngest player in Champions League history to reach twenty goals (although this record would then be surpassed by Erling Haaland later on in the same season).[107][108]

        On 16 February 2021, Mbappé became only the third player, after Faustino Asprilla and Andriy Shevchenko, to score a Champions League hat-trick against Barcelona, doing so in PSG's 4–1 round of 16 win at the Camp Nou.[109] Mbappé's hat-trick also saw him overtake Pauleta's total of 109 goals to become PSG's third-highest scorer, with only Cavani (200 goals) and Zlatan Ibrahimović (156 goals) getting more for the club.[110] On 27 February, Mbappé scored twice in a 4–0 away win against Dijon, becoming the first player to score five braces in the Ligue 1 season.[111] In the second leg against Barcelona on 10 March, Mbappé scored from the spot in a 1–1 draw at the Parc de Princes, as his side advanced to the quarter-finals 5–2 on aggregate.[112] Mbappé's penalty was his 25th Champions League goal, surpassing opponent Lionel Messi as the youngest player to reach this milestone, at 22 years and 80 days. Adding to his hat-trick from the first leg, Mbappé additionally became the first player to score four goals against Barcelona in a single Champions League season.[113]

        In the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final against Bayern Munich on 7 April, Mbappé scored two goals, helping his team to a 3–2 win at the Allianz Arena, PSG's first victory in Munich since 1994.[114] The French club later progressed to the semi-finals to be eventually eliminated by Manchester City: the forward missed the second leg due to a calf injury.[115] On 19 May, Mbappé scored once and assisted the second in the Coupe de France final against his former club Monaco, as PSG won 2–0 to claim their first major trophy of the season.[116] He ended the Ligue 1 campaign with 27 goals, becoming the top scorer for the third consecutive season, although PSG missed out on the Ligue 1 title – it was the first time in Mbappé's career where he did not win the league after four consecutive successes.[117][118] Mbappé ended the season by receiving the Ligue 1 Player of the Year award and being included in the Ligue 1 Team of the Season.[119]

        On 14 August 2021, prior to Paris Saint-Germain's opening home match of the 2021–22 season against Strasbourg, Mbappé was booed by the Parc des Princes amidst rumours that he wanted to sign for Spanish club Real Madrid.[120] The match ended in a 4–2 victory for the Parisians, with the forward setting up three of his team's goals.[121] He scored his first goal of the season in a 4–2 away win against Brest six days later.[122] In the following match against Reims on 29 August, in which Lionel Messi notably made his debut for PSG, Mbappé scored a brace in a 2–0 Rouge-et-Bleu victory.[123] On 24 November, he scored in a 2–1 Champions League defeat to Manchester City at the City of Manchester Stadium.[124] On 7 December, he scored two goals in a 4–1 Champions League home win over Club Brugge. The goals, which were his 30th and 31st in the Champions League, made him the youngest player to reach this milestone in the history of the competition.[125]

        On 12 December 2021, Mbappé scored twice against Monaco in Ligue 1 to reach a century of league goals for PSG. At 22 years and 357 days old, he became the youngest player to score 100 goals for a single team in the French top-flight since Opta began recording data in the 1950–51 season.[126] On 3 January 2022, Mbappé scored his first hat-trick of the season in a 4–0 Coupe de France win over Vannes.[127] On 11 February, he scored the winning goal in stoppage time in a 1–0 league win over Rennes,[128] a feat he repeated four days later, in a 1–0 Champions League victory over Real Madrid in the first leg of the round of 16.[129] He scored another goal in the second leg, making him the second-highest goalscorer in Paris Saint-Germain's history; however, his team was knocked out following a 3–1 defeat at the Santiago Bernabéu.[130][131]

        On 21 May 2022, Mbappé extended his contract with PSG until 2025,[132] despite speculations of a possible transfer to Real Madrid,[133] which prompted La Liga officials to file a complaint to UEFA regarding accumulating losses of PSG in the previous years.[134] Mbappé himself reportedly called and spoke to Real Madrid's president Florentino Pérez, telling him that he would not be signing for Real Madrid.[135] According to Sky Sports, the financial details of Mbappé's contract included a monthly wage of £4 million, making him the highest-paid player in the world.[136] Mbappé and PSG also reportedly secured a signing-on figure in the region of £100 million.[136] In the hours following the forward's contract extension, he scored a hat-trick in a 5–0 win over Metz, to finish the season with 28 goals as top scorer for the fourth consecutive season.[137] He became the third player to finish as Ligue 1's top scorer for four seasons in a row. Mbappé also provided 17 assists in the season, becoming the first player to finish as both top scorer and top assist provider in the league's history.[138][139]

        On 13 August 2022, Mbappé scored his first goal of the season for PSG in a 5–2 home victory over Montpellier, after having missed a penalty earlier in the match.[140] Eight days later, he scored his first hat-trick of the season in a 7–1 away win over Lille.[141] His first goal in the match was clocked at eight seconds, making it the second-fastest goal ever scored in Ligue 1 history, tenths of seconds later than Michel Rio's goal for Caen against Cannes in 1992.[142] On 6 September, Mbappé scored a brace in PSG's opening Champions League fixture against Juventus, securing a 2–1 home victory for the Parisians.[143] On 11 October, he scored a penalty in a 1–1 Champions League draw at home to Benfica, becoming the leading goal scorer for PSG in European competitions with 31 goals.[144] However, the match was played in the backdrop of media reports that Mbappé wanted to leave PSG in the January transfer window, rumours which he denied, saying, "I'm very happy. I never asked for my departure in January."[145]

        On 23 January 2023, Mbappé became the first PSG player to score five goals in a match, including a ten-minute hat-trick, in a 7–0 rout of Pays de Cassel in the Coupe de France round of 32.[146] On 26 February, he scored two goals and assisted another as PSG defeated Marseille 3–0 in Le Classique.

        <br><b>Player profile</b><br>
        <br><b>Style of play</b><br>

        Mbappé's movement is often highlighted as one of his most important assets
        A versatile forward, Mbappé often plays as a winger, and is capable of playing on either flank, due to his ability with both feet.[249][250] He is capable of cutting into the centre onto his stronger right foot from the left wing, and of creating chances and providing assists for teammates from the right thanks to his vision.[251][252][253][254] He is also able to play in the centre as a main striker, due to his composure, clinical finishing, and eye for goal.[255][256][257][258]

        A skillful player, Mbappé is known for his dribbling ability, as well as his acceleration, agility, quick feet, first touch, link-up play and creativity when in possession of the ball, as demonstrated by his use of elaborate feints, such as step overs, or sudden changes of pace or direction to beat opponents in one-on-one situations.[259][260][261] He is highly regarded for his pace and close ball control when dribbling at speed, as well as his movement, tactical intelligence, and ability to beat the defensive line by making attacking runs into space both on and off the ball.[251][260] His ability to time his runs enables him to stretch opposing defences, making him a dangerous offensive threat on counter-attacks.[251][260][262][263]

        During the beginning of his career, Mbappé was compared to various greats in the history of football. He was described by Arsène Wenger as a "huge football talent" who "has similar qualities" to Thierry Henry.[264] His talent and stand-out performances for France at the 2018 World Cup also led him to be compared to Pelé in the media.[265] Former France international player Nicolas Anelka said that Mbappé's ability to run at defences reminded him of Ronaldo's performances at the 1996 Olympics, and that Mbappé had the characteristics of a "world-class player".[266]

        Reception
        Widely regarded as the best player in the world since the decline of the Messi–Ronaldo dominance, Mbappé is generally viewed as one of the best players of his generation.[267][268][269] His individual and collective achievements, as well as his precocious development, have drawn much appraisal. Former French international Rio Mavuba remarked that if Mbappé had won the 2022 World Cup "he'd probably be the best French player (ever)", further saying "I love [Zinedine] Zidane but imagine, 23 years old, two World Cups, he'd be the best."[270] During that same World Cup, Fox Sports deemed Mbappé as already one of the "World Cup's all-time greats" and "the best player in the world".[271]

        Mbappé was named the fastest player in the world in a ranking by French newspaper Le Figaro.[272] Central defender and Dutch international Stefan de Vrij cited the Frenchman as "his toughest opponent" ahead of anyone else.[273] In 2018, the forward was considered the world's most expensive player from a transfer value perspective by the CIES.[274] His performances for his club and national team have seen him shortlisted for the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year in 2019[275] and 2023.[276][277]

        Mbappé is a practising Christian.[278] In a 2018 interview with Time, he spoke about the sacrifices he made as a teenager to focus on his football development: "I did not have the moments of so-called normal people during adolescence, like going out with friends, enjoying good times." But despite missing out on a "normal" life, Mbappé states he is "living the life he always dreamed of".[279]

        Just over four years after making his professional debut, he had over 50 million followers on Instagram.[279] As of 2023, he has over 100 million followers on Instagram.[280] While he admits his "life has been totally turned upside down" since he first entered the spotlight, he says he is "happy".[279] He is fluent in French, English, and Spanish.[281]

        During UEFA Euro 2024, Mbappé spoke at a press conference to tell the younger generation to vote against what he deemed "extreme views" in the 2024 French legislative election.[282][283]

        In October 2024, authorities in Sweden launched a rape and sexual harassment investigation against Mbappe following a visit he made to the Swedish capital of Stockholm.[284] On 12 December 2024, the investigation was closed, with Swedish prosecutor Marina Chirakova citing insufficient evidence.[285]

        Mbappé has featured in EA Sports' FIFA video game series: on FIFA 18, he had the highest potential rating of 94.[289] His trademark goal celebration – posing with his arms folded and hands tucked under his armpits – was inspired by his younger brother Ethan, who would celebrate in this manner when beating Kylian at FIFA.[290][291] The celebration was first inserted in FIFA 19.[292] Mbappé featured as the cover star of FIFA 21, making him the youngest to appear on the cover solo.[293]

        In 2023, he was included by Time among the 100 most influential people in the world;[294] in the same year, he was ranked third in the Forbes list of the world's highest-paid athletes.[295]
